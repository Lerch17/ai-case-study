#  **A Case Study of xAI**

## *Overview and origin*

This case study will attempt to take a dive into the Ai start up created by one of the most influential humans on earth today. Whether you are a fan or not; almost everyone is curious what Tech Billionaire, Elon Musk, thinks of today’s biggest advancement and challenges. In an interesting move Elon musk stepped down from the board of OpenAI, the nonprofit research group he co-founded with Sam Altman. Elon left to avoid a conflict of interest between Open AI's work, and the research being done by tesla to develop autonomous driving through machine learning. Musk also expressed concerns about how OpenAI was pursuing a for profit structure, and how it was prioritized over the mission of helping the world and developing technology for the public good.

On March 9, 2023, Elon musk would incorporate his own Ai company, Ai, and would officially announce its formation on July 12, 2023. Musk started his company with a bang when he hired Igor Babushkin, formerly associated with Google's DeepMind unit, to be his Chief Engineer. Musk has been very open that the formation of xAI was, in part, to be a relevant competitor to Google/DeepMind, focusing on the impact of AI on society. Elon would fund his new company on his own at the beginning, staying true to his statements of prioritizing AI impact over profitability. However, on May26, 2024 he announced a Series B funding round which would generate 6 billion Dollars, reaching a post-money valuation of 24 billion. 
> "Our Series B funding round of $6 billion with participation from key investors including Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and Kingdom Holding, amongst others."

## *Business Activity*

There are multiple problems xAI is trying to solve. First and foremost is to develop an Ai that can accelerate human scientific discovery benefiting all humankind for the better. It is also no secret that as the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon, wants xAI to work hand in glove with his other companies to give him full control on its impacts in his businesses. He has also demonstrated with his purchase of Twitter, the largest social media platform on earth with over 500 million users, that he wishes to help pierce the veil and help bring truth to the people of the world without regard to popularity or political correctness. This will be one of the major advantages that xAI will have, an AI with access to a real time feed of world events through the X platform.

The first product being produced by xAI is a chat bot called Grok. To access Grok in its early stages; you must have a Premium+ subscription X, formerly Twitter. xAI has made a giant effort to create transparency behind Grok-1, which is the model that powers this chatbot. On November 6, 2023, xAI would announce PromptIDE which is, < "An integrated development environment for prompt engineering and interpretability research." > The idea behind this is to help combat the uncertainty behind the black box issue with Ai which is to better understand how Grok reaches its conclusions and predictions. This decision, I believe, helps humanity better trust Ai; but also keeps humans in control of AI without our worst sci-fi nightmares coming true. As of April 12, 2024, xAi released a preview into Grok-1.5 which shows just how effective Grok has become in relation to its major chatbot competitors. We will look at these comparisons in the results section of this case study.

## *Landscape*

xAI lives in the field of Artificial intelligence, with a niche in Explainable Artificial Intelligence. Explainable Artificial intelligence is a set of tools and methods that help everyday people understand, and hopefully, trust the results of machine learning algorithms. xAI is what I would consider being one of the most cutting-edge companies in AI, as far as helping humanity control AI.
While Ai seems to be taking over industries overnight and has only now become a hot topic around the world; there have been major innovations and benchmarks over the last 20 years. here we will look at a few that have made a lasting impact in our everyday lives.
### 1. Deep Blue- 1997
Deep Blue was developed by IBM and became the first computer in the world to win a chess series against a world champion. "In a pair of six-game chess matches that lasted several days, Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov proving that computers can indeed handle complex calculations. Just so you know, Deep Blue could calculate 200 million possible chess positions per second."
This development would be the dominos that started discovering new medical drugs and creating large financial modeling to help accurately identify trends and do risk analysis, handling large database searches. 

### 2. Roomba- 2002
The idea for Roomba came from iRobot CEO Colin Angle. Angle would study robotics at MIT and would later work with the US defense department to develop robots that could clear minefields. This work led to an AI system that enabled robots to check every square inch of a certain field to ensure no mines were unfound. This would inspire Angel to create the Roomba, the robot that could clean the entire area of your house without humans being present. 

### 3. Siri- 2010
Today everyone with an iPhone can tell you how amazing Siri was once added to the iPhone. Siri would mark the beginning of the Virtual Assistant era. 
"Siri was the first intelligent personal assistant to replace keyboards and touch screens. In a highly natural voice, Siri would make recommendations, schedule events, answer questions, adjust device settings and run searches. The more users would interact with Siri, the more it would adapt to their individual preferences." 
Years later, Amazon would develop a similar assistant with Alexa. Microsoft would develop Cortana, and Google would create Google assistant, however the results were not as effective as Siri, and that remains the case today.  

### 4. OpenAI- 2018
In 2018 Elon Musk's research group OpenAI created a bot that could compete in a popular video game, defeating top teams around the world. the bot utilized different algorithms and would learn from playing different versions of itself and did not use imitation learning or tree search. This would lead to one of the largest breakthroughs in AI since previously algorithms usually operated independently of each other. This was a seen as a step towards building AI systems that could accomplish well defined goals in messy situations involving humanity. This discovery would spark the rapid AI growth we all have witnessed in today’s time.

## *Results*
There are a few ways to measure Ai chatbot Benchmark metrics. MMMU, Mathvista, AI2D, TextVQA, ChartQA, DocVQA, and RealWorldQA. We won’t dive into the financial metrics of xAI as we have already stated how it is being funded and the company has only been around for under two years. It is difficult to measure the full impact of xAI as the company has only been around for less than two years. However, we can compare xAI's first project, a virtual assistant called Gronk, to its competitors to measure what they have been able to accomplish in this short time.
We will look at how Gronk-1.5 compares to its biggest competitors. They are: GPT-4V (openAI), Claude 3 Sonnet (Amazon), Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic), Gemini Pro 1.5 (Google)

### MMMU
Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic) leads the way when it comes to Multi-discipline Multimodal Understanding and Reasoning with a Benchmark rating of 59.4% While Grok-1.5 rounds out the bottom of the pack with 53.6%, and Clude 3 Sonnet(amazon) sits at the bottom with 53.1%. 
### Mathvista
Grok-1.5 does lead in understanding Mathvista, which is a benchamark designed to combine challenges from diverse mathematical and visual tasks. Grok-1.5 come in at52.8% with Googles Gemini Pro 1.5 being in a close second at 52.1%. Nearly all other major competitors fall at least 2% behind here.
### AI2D, TextVQA, ChartQA, DocVQA
Grok-1.5 also compares very competitively in benchmarks AI2D (understanding diagrams), TextVQA (Read and reason about text in images), ChartQA (visual and logical reasoning over charts) and DocVQA(Document Visual Question Answering)
### RealWorldQA
Real World QA is a Benchmark specific to xAI that measures real-world spatial understanding. This is an area where xAI has a real advantage over most competitors as it gives Gronk full access and real time learning from the X social media platform, pulling trends from the social platforms' 500 million users around the world. Gronk pulls in the top benchmark score of 68.7% with Google's Gemini Pro 1.5 coming in second with 67.5%. all other competitors fall almost 10-20% behind Grok-1.5 on this benchmark.

## *Recommendations*

While I do not feel qualified to make recommendations to Elon Musk, I would like to imagine some other products to come for xAI. Without a doubt, we can conclude that there will be other products that are heavily used in Elon's other companies. Tesla will use the research into machine learning to continue to develop electric cars with the autonomous driving feature. SpaceX will most likely us AI to help solve the issues complicating humankind colonizing mars. Outside of these future products I would personally like to see a new competitor to the smartphone market.

I have had and used an Apple iPhone for the since the iPhone 3s came out in 2009. Apple always did a great job of creating a product with beautiful UI and a simplicity that made their phones easy for most generations to use. At this point my iPhone is a comfort and the thought of having an Android phone again feels dreadful. However, outside of those two options there are no other serious competitors. With Apple looking to add its new “apple Intelligence" to their newest iPhone, there is a lot of uncertainty revolving around the AI's capabilities and personal Privacy. Elon Musk himself has stated with apple's new AI he will not permit workers in his buildings to have or use apple products with these capabilities, and visitors to his factories will have to check them in before entering. Given the uncertainty around the capabilities of Ai, I imagine there will be a large market for an alternative phone for people who wish for options other than an android phone. Therefore, I believe an X phone with an emphasis on the use of Explainable AI would be a promising alternative to a very large portion of iPhone users who are looking for more alternatives.
